[Verse 1]
Arrive at seven the place feels good
No time to call you today
Encores 'til eleven, then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

[Verse 2]
I call your number; the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love, I can't tell you how I feel

[Refrain]
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

[Verse 3]
Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again
[Refrain]
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere
Miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
